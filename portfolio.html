            <h3>BDO Mind Munchies</h3>
            <p>
              Mind Munchies is a concept created for the BDO New Venture case competition, proposing natural cookies aimed at enhancing concentration and focus for university students. The idea included snacks with brain-boosting ingredients like Theobromine, Creatine, and Omega-3, providing a healthier alternative to caffeinated drinks. I showcased my finance, marketing, and leadership skills by guiding and contributing to this innovative solution.

            <p>
              At RIZE, a sports event management company, I was deeply involved in both outreach and financial operations.

This role strengthened my financial management and communication skills in a dynamic context.
