                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    <p>I developed an AI-powered stock prediction tool that analyzes historical data and macroeconomic indicators, 
                    a predictive accuracy of 85%. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>What was used?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This project integrated machine learning models with a data pipeline that incorporates 
                        Python libraries for data fetching, preprocessing, and model training. Leveraging tools like Yahoo Finance API 
                        for stock data, APScheduler for automated retraining, and Matplotlib for data visualization, 
                        the system enhances overall robustness and accuracy.

                    <h4>The interface?</h4>
                    <p>                       
                    The tool includes a Flask web interface for user interaction, 
                    automated model retraining, and comprehensive data visualization.

                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I created an XML-based database integration using VBA and SQL to connect Microsoft Access with Excel, 
                        significantly transforming data handling processes. 
                        This project involved designing and implementing a seamless data transfer mechanism between Access and Excel, 
                        ensuring data integrity and efficiency. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>What does it to?</h4>
                    <p>
                        By utilizing VBA, I automated complex data tasks and streamlined workflows, 
                        reducing manual input and error rates. 
                        Additionally, I employed SQL for advanced data queries and manipulations, 
                        enabling robust data analysis and reporting capabilities. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>How Did it Help?</h4>
                    <p>
                        This integration demonstrated my advanced database management skills, 
                        as I developed a system that optimized data processing, improved accuracy, 
                        and enhanced overall operational efficiency, 
                        showcasing the full potential of Microsoft Office tools in a professional setting.

                    <h4>What is it?</h4>
                    <p>t’s a real-time computer vision-based tool that turns a webcam into a virtual whiteboard, allowing users to draw math expressions in the air using only their index finger. 
                        The system uses fingertip tracking powered by MediaPipe to trace gestures onto a digital canvas.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What Does it Do?</h4>
                    <p>
                        It continuously monitors the webcam feed, detects when the user’s index finger is extended, 
                        and draws its movement onto a white canvas. 
                        Once the user finishes drawing, 
                        the tool uses OCR to convert the air-drawn expression into text and evaluates the result instantly.

                    <h4>How Does it Help?</h4>
                    <p>
                        It enables a hands-free and hardware-free method for solving math, ideal for presentations, classroom use, or individuals with mobility limitations. By combining gesture recognition with math OCR, 
                        it makes learning and computation more interactive, accessible, and engaging.
